## 📝 Overview

In this module, you will learn how to control the flow of your Python programs using conditional statements. We will cover everything from basic `if` statements to more complex nested conditions and logical operators.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Understanding Conditional Statements 🤔

Learn the basics of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements and how they are used to control program execution based on different conditions.

### 2. Comparison Operators 🔍

Grasp how to use comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` to compare values in Python.

### 3. Logical Operators 🧠

Delve into logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`, and understand how to combine them with conditional statements.

### 4. Nested Conditional Statements 📦

Discover how to use conditional statements within other conditional statements to create complex decision-making structures.

### 5. Short Circuiting ⚡

Understand how Python optimizes conditions with `and` and `or` operators by stopping the evaluation as soon as the outcome is determined.

### 6. Ternary Operator ⚖️

Get to know the shorthand syntax for writing simple conditional statements in a single line of code.

### 7. Truthiness and Falsiness 🆚

Explore how Python evaluates non-Boolean values in conditional statements and the concept of truthiness and falsiness.

### 8. Best Practices 🏅

Learn tips for writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic conditional statements.
