## 📝 Module Overview

In this module, you will learn how to control the flow of your Python programs using **conditional statements**. We will cover everything from basic `if` statements to more complex nested conditions and logical operators.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 1. Understanding Conditional Statements 🤔
Learn the basics of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements and how they are used to control program execution based on different conditions.

### 2. Comparison Operators 🔍
Learn to use comparison operators like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` to compare values in Python.

### 3. Logical Operators 🧠
Understand how to combine conditions using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.

### 4. Nested Conditional Statements 📦
Explore how to use **conditional statements** within other conditional statements to create more complex decision-making logic.

### 5. Short-Circuit Evaluation ⚡
Learn how Python evaluates conditions in logical statements, optimizing performance by stopping evaluation once the result is determined.

### 6. Ternary Operator ⚖️
Get to know the shorthand syntax for simple conditional statements in a single line of code using the **ternary operator**.

### 7. Truthiness and Falsiness 🆚
Discover how Python evaluates non-Boolean values in conditional statements and how to leverage the concept of **truthiness** and **falsiness**.

### 8. Best Practices 🏅
Learn tips for writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic conditional statements.
